# Weather Classification Model for Landscape Images

This model uses advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to automatically classify landscape images based on the weather conditions present when the images were captured. The goal of this model is to help users quickly categorize images into weather types such as sunny, rainy, cloudy, or others, simply by uploading the landscape pictures.

How It Works:
	•	Input: Upload a landscape image.
	•	Process: The model analyzes the image and applies advanced algorithms to detect patterns related to the weather in the scene.
	•	Output: The model returns a prediction indicating the likely weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.) when the image was taken.

Why Use It:

This tool is designed to streamline the process of organizing and classifying large collections of landscape images. Whether you’re working with a personal photo album, a weather research project, or any other type of image collection, this model will help you quickly sort your images based on the weather captured in them.
